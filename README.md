# BAE-305-WaterSensor
### Project Summary
For this project, we created a device that could be inserted into a water sample and read the pH and turbidity. These values could then be displayed to the user and alert them as to whether or not the liquid is safe to consume based on the pH and clarity. The device contains a pH probe that the user can insert into the liquid and a LED and phototransistor that can be shined into the liquid and have the phototransistor pick up on the amount of light that shines through.

As a result of completing this project, we are able to accurately determine the pH of a sample as well as use the values obtained from the phototransistor and LED to scale an appropriate value for the turbidity reading. This allows the user to determine whether a sample of water is safe for consumption based on these parameters. We would, however, use additional testing in order to determine other concentrations of possible contaminants/pollutants.
### Design Description
For this design, we used a pH probe, LED, phototransistor, potentiometer, LCD display, and a button. We used Arduino to write the code and a breadboard and Redboard to do the wiring and construction. 

Shown below is the wiring diagram for our set-up.

The device used to house the sensors and test the water is a simple modified cup, blacked out with spray to avoid any unwanted light interference. The images below are CAD recreations of the cup.
